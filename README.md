# Why is this repository public?

I made this repository public, because at this moment I don't have many projects (mainly with Python and ML) to show to recruiters. In the future I will change it visibility to "private", because this is not good enough project to brag about, especially since it ended in failure.

# About project

I scrapped some data about dogs from [DogTime](https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/profiles) website and wanted to classify dogs to proper Dog Breed Group on features found on this website. Then I did short, but meaty EDA with data visualization and tried machine learning, but it turned out to be a huge failure.

# Conclusions

Any ML method in this project has failed due to data. The dataset was far too small and features used were not good indicators of the breed to which the dog should be included.
